🚀 My Evolving GitHub Portfolio
Hi there! I'm Sreesankar, a first-year BCA student. This repository is a chronicle of my journey into advanced software development. After building a strong foundation, I'm now diving deeper into the world of mobile app development, machine learning,  database management and system designing.

🧠 Current Focus & Learning
✅ Flutter & Dart – Gaining hands-on experience in cross-platform mobile app development.

✅ Vector LLM Models – Exploring the creation and fine-tuning of my own language models.

✅ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – Learning to improve LLM accuracy by integrating external data.

✅ PostgreSQL – Mastering database management for modern applications.

✅ Python – Applying my knowledge to machine learning and back-end development.

📁 Project Structure
🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This is a collection of my evolving skills and projects. Through practical applications and scripts, I'm:

Building real-world mobile and web applications with Flutter and PostgreSQL.

Experimenting with AI/ML concepts by building my own vector LLM models.

Documenting my progress in learning how to fine-tune and use RAG for more powerful AI solutions.

Continuing to practice version control with Git and GitHub.

🌱 Learning in Progress
I'll be updating this repo regularly as I take on new challenges and learn more complex concepts. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
